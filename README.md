After pressing play, you are lead to the main playing screen. You can choose from 16 different buttons to make sounds. You choose one button at a time from each section; beat, bass, synth and pad.

Once you press a button, the corresponding sound will begin playing and the other buttons in that section become disabled as to prevent the sounds from overlapping. If you press the same button again, it'll stop playing and reset, enabling the other buttons again.

When a button is pressed, the character will also start dancing. If you press more buttons, different dances will play. There are 4 dances in total for each section. If no buttons are pressed, an idle animation will play.

When a button is pressed, a timer, represented by a progress bar for each section, is also triggered. The timer is used to show when the sound playing will loop. This is so you can try play each sound in time with each other.

On the right side, there is a volume slider. You can slide it up and down to lower or higher the volume of all the sounds, or mute them altogether. It automatically starts in the middle so that it's set at a normal volume.
